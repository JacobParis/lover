# Lover

Lover is a low-contrast theme for VS Code, available in light and dark modes.

Prior to my developer career I was a welder, which is great for building cool things and not so great on the skin, nose, ears, and eyes. Since then eyes have developed a bit of sensitivity to bright lights and vibrant changes of contrast. This theme is designed to be much milder on the eyes with a dark theme for normal use and a light theme for reduced glare when outdoors.

I work primarily in React and Vue so issues relating to non-web code or other frameworks are very likely. Feel free to file an issue or pull request with any suggestions or improvements üôè
